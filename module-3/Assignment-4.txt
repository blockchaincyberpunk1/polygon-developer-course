Building a Simple Polygon DApp

Objective:
The objective of this assignment is to challenge students to apply their knowledge by building a basic Polygon-based decentralized application (DApp). Students will be provided with a simple DApp idea or use case, such as a token minting and transfer application. They will then be tasked with developing the DApp using Polygon Studio and Remix, and finally, deploying it to the Polygon testnet.

Instructions:

Introduction: Begin by introducing the assignment's objective, which is to develop a simple decentralized application (DApp) on the Polygon network. Explain the significance of hands-on development in gaining practical experience.

DApp Idea or Use Case: Provide students with a specific DApp idea or use case. For example, you can suggest building a token minting and transfer DApp. Describe the primary functionality and features of the DApp.

Development Tools: Instruct students to use the following development tools for this assignment:

a. Polygon Studio: Explain how to set up and use Polygon Studio for development. Provide any necessary links or resources for installing and configuring Polygon Studio.

b. Remix: Encourage students to utilize Remix for smart contract development, testing, and deployment. Explain how to connect Remix to the Polygon testnet.

DApp Development: Task students with developing the DApp according to the provided idea or use case. They should:

a. Write the smart contracts required for the DApp's functionality using Solidity in Remix.

b. Test the smart contracts thoroughly within Remix, ensuring they work as intended.

c. Develop a user interface (UI) for the DApp using web development technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript). They can use libraries like web3.js or ethers.js to interact with the smart contracts.

d. Implement the logic for the DApp's functionality, such as token minting and transferring.

Testing and Debugging: Encourage students to test and debug their DApp thoroughly to ensure it functions correctly.

Deployment to Polygon Testnet: Instruct students to deploy their DApp to the Polygon testnet. Explain the deployment process, including specifying the network, gas settings, and contract deployment.

Documentation: Ask students to document their development process. They should provide a brief overview of the DApp's functionality, the smart contracts they developed, and the technologies used. Also, encourage them to document any challenges faced and how they were resolved.

Submission: Students should submit their DApp, including the smart contracts, user interface code, and documentation. The submission should include all necessary files in a compressed format (e.g., ZIP) and be uploaded to the course platform by the specified deadline.

Grading Criteria:
Your assignment will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

Successful development of the DApp with the specified functionality.
Accuracy and completeness of the documentation.
Proper deployment of the DApp to the Polygon testnet.
Adherence to the specified deadline for submission.
