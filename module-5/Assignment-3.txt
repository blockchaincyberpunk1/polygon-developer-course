Building and Testing a dApp Prototype

Objective:
The objective of this assignment is to provide students with hands-on experience in decentralized application (dApp) development on the Polygon network. Students will be tasked with developing a basic dApp prototype for a specific use case (e.g., a decentralized voting system) and utilizing Ethereum-compatible smart contracts for Polygon.

Instructions:

Introduction to the Assignment: Begin by introducing the assignment's objective, which is to build and test a dApp prototype on the Polygon network. Explain that this assignment will involve practical development steps.

Use Case Selection: Select a specific use case for the assignment (e.g., a decentralized voting system). Describe the functionalities and requirements of the dApp for the chosen use case. Define the purpose and key features the dApp should include.

Smart Contracts for Polygon: Instruct students to use Ethereum-compatible smart contracts for Polygon in their dApp development. Explain that these smart contracts can be written in Solidity and will be deployed on the Polygon network.

Dapp Development: Task students with developing a basic dApp prototype for the selected use case. Provide guidance on the following aspects:

a. Smart Contract Development: Instruct students to develop the necessary smart contracts to handle the core functionalities of the dApp. This may include creating, reading, and updating data on the Polygon network.

b. Front-End Development: Guide students in creating a user-friendly front-end interface for the dApp. They can use web development technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript or a framework like React.js.

c. Integration: Ensure that students understand how to connect the front end of their dApp to the Polygon network and interact with the deployed smart contracts.

Testing: Encourage students to thoroughly test their dApp prototype to ensure that it functions as intended. They should test various scenarios to cover different use cases and identify any potential issues.

Documentation: Ask students to document their development process, including explanations of the dApp's functionalities, any challenges they encountered, and how they resolved them.

Submission: Students should submit the following:

The code for their dApp prototype, including smart contract code and front-end code.
Documentation detailing the development process, including challenges and solutions.
A brief summary of the testing they conducted on the dApp prototype.
Optional: Presentation or Demonstration (Instructor's Discretion): Depending on the course format, you may ask students to present or demonstrate their dApp prototype to the class.

Grading Criteria:
Your assignment will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

Successful development of the dApp prototype.
Quality and clarity of documentation of the development process.
Thorough testing of the dApp prototype.
Adherence to the specified deadline for submission.
