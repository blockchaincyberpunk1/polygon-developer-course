Blockchain Basics

Objective:
The objective of this assignment is to establish a strong foundation in blockchain fundamentals for students. By studying the provided resources on blockchain technology, including distributed ledgers, consensus algorithms, and cryptographic principles, students will gain a deep understanding of these crucial concepts. This assignment requires students to demonstrate their comprehension by creating a presentation or infographic that visually explains one of these fundamental concepts.

Instructions:

Study Resources: Begin by exploring the following resources to build a solid understanding of blockchain technology:

Read the selected articles or chapters from a recommended blockchain fundamentals book.
Watch videos or lectures on distributed ledgers, consensus algorithms, and cryptographic principles. Specific resources will be provided on the course platform.
Choose a Fundamental Concept: Select one of the following fundamental blockchain concepts to focus on for your presentation or infographic:

Distributed Ledgers
Consensus Algorithms (e.g., Proof of Work, Proof of Stake)
Cryptographic Principles (e.g., hash functions, digital signatures)
Create a Presentation or Infographic: Using your chosen concept, create either a presentation or an infographic that visually explains the selected concept. Your presentation should consist of slides (e.g., PowerPoint or Google Slides), while your infographic should be a single-page visual representation.
