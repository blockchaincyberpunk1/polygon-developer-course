Secure DApp Development on Polygon

Objective:
The objective of this assignment is to guide students in implementing security best practices when developing decentralized applications (dApps) on the Polygon network. Students will be presented with a dApp development scenario (e.g., a DeFi application) and potential security risks associated with it. They will then be tasked with developing a secure dApp prototype on Polygon, incorporating security measures to protect against common vulnerabilities.

Instructions:

Introduction to Secure DApp Development: Begin by explaining the critical importance of secure dApp development on the Polygon network. Emphasize that security vulnerabilities can result in significant financial losses and erode trust in blockchain applications.

DApp Development Scenario: Provide students with a dApp development scenario or use case. For example, you can present a DeFi application scenario where users can lend and borrow assets on Polygon. Describe the main functionalities and features of the dApp.

Security Risks: Describe potential security risks and vulnerabilities that are relevant to the provided dApp scenario. Common vulnerabilities may include reentrancy attacks, data manipulation, access control issues, and others.

DApp Prototype Development: Task students with developing a secure dApp prototype for the provided scenario on the Polygon network. They should follow these steps:

a. Smart Contract Development: Write the necessary smart contracts for the dApp, ensuring they incorporate secure coding practices.

b. Front-end Development: Develop the user interface (UI) for the dApp, including secure user authentication and input validation.

c. Security Measures: Implement security measures and best practices to protect against the identified security risks. This may include access control mechanisms, secure data handling, and proper error handling.

d. Testing: Thoroughly test the dApp prototype to ensure its functionality and security. Test cases should include scenarios that could trigger potential vulnerabilities.

Documentation: Students should document their dApp development process, including code explanations, security measures implemented, and testing results. The documentation should serve as a guide for others to understand and replicate their secure dApp.

Presentation (Instructor's Discretion): Depending on the course format, you may ask students to present their secure dApp prototype and share their documentation with the class.

Submission: Students should submit their dApp prototype and documentation as a package on the course platform by the specified deadline.

Grading Criteria:
Your assignment will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

Successful development of a secure dApp prototype.
Clarity and completeness of the documentation, including code explanations and security measures.
Thorough testing to ensure functionality and security.
Adherence to the specified deadline for submission.
