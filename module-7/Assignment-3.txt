Auditing a Polygon Smart Contract

Objective:
The objective of this assignment is to provide students with hands-on experience in auditing smart contracts deployed on the Polygon network. Students will be given a smart contract deployed on Polygon specifically for auditing purposes. The contract will contain security vulnerabilities. Students will be tasked with conducting a thorough security audit of the smart contract, identifying and documenting any vulnerabilities or issues, and suggesting improvements.

Instructions:

Introduction to Smart Contract Auditing: Begin by explaining the importance of auditing smart contracts for security and reliability. Emphasize that auditing helps identify vulnerabilities and ensures the integrity of blockchain applications.

Smart Contract Selection: Provide students with a smart contract deployed on the Polygon network that contains security vulnerabilities. Ensure that the contract represents a real-world use case or scenario. The contract should be accessible for auditing but not for malicious purposes.

Auditing Process: Task students with conducting a comprehensive security audit of the provided smart contract. They should follow these steps:

a. Code Review: Analyze the contract's source code, including functions, variables, and logic. Look for potential vulnerabilities, such as reentrancy, unchecked user inputs, or insecure data handling.

b. Testing: Execute test transactions and interactions with the contract to identify any issues related to its functionality or security.

c. Documentation: Document the vulnerabilities or issues identified during the audit. Include detailed explanations of each issue and its potential impact.

Improvement Recommendations: After identifying vulnerabilities, instruct students to propose improvements or modifications to the smart contract's code to address these issues. Explain how each proposed change mitigates a specific vulnerability.

Report Preparation: Students should compile their audit findings and improvement recommendations into a comprehensive report. The report should include the following sections:

a. Introduction to the Audited Contract: Provide an introduction to the smart contract, its purpose, and its key functions.

b. Audit Findings: Document the vulnerabilities and issues identified during the audit, including code snippets and explanations.

c. Improvement Recommendations: Present the proposed code improvements to mitigate the identified vulnerabilities.

d. Testing Results: Share the results of any testing performed on the contract to validate vulnerabilities or issues.

Presentation (Instructor's Discretion): Depending on the course format, you may ask students to present key findings and improvement recommendations from their reports to the class.

Submission: Students should submit their audit report as a PDF or other suitable format on the course platform by the specified deadline.

Grading Criteria:
Your assignment will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

Thoroughness of the security audit, including identification of vulnerabilities.
Clarity and effectiveness of the proposed code improvements.
Documentation quality, including detailed explanations and code examples.
Adherence to the specified deadline for submission.
