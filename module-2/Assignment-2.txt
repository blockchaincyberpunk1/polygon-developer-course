Ethereum Scaling Solutions Research

Objective:
The objective of this assignment is to encourage students to explore various scaling solutions for Ethereum, including Layer 2 solutions like Polygon, rollups, sidechains, and sharding. Students will conduct research on one scaling solution of their choice, create a presentation or report, and present how the selected solution works, its advantages, and potential drawbacks.

Instructions:

Study Resources: Begin by exploring the provided resources or articles that explain different scaling solutions for Ethereum. These resources should cover Layer 2 solutions (e.g., Polygon), rollups, sidechains, and sharding. Specific resources will be available on the course platform.

Select a Scaling Solution: Choose one scaling solution from the options provided. You will be researching and presenting this solution in your assignment.

Research and Create a Presentation/Report: Conduct in-depth research on your selected scaling solution and create either a presentation or a report that covers the following aspects:

How It Works: Explain the technical workings of the scaling solution. Describe its architecture, consensus mechanism (if applicable), and how it interacts with the Ethereum network.
Advantages: Discuss the benefits and advantages of the chosen scaling solution. Consider factors such as scalability, transaction speed, reduced gas fees, and improved user experience.
Potential Drawbacks: Identify and analyze any potential drawbacks, limitations, or challenges associated with the scaling solution. This could include security concerns, centralization risks, or adoption challenges.
Formatting Guidelines:

If you choose to create a presentation, use PowerPoint or Google Slides to organize your content into slides. Ensure that the presentation is visually engaging and informative.
If you choose to create a report, structure it with clear headings and subheadings. Use a formal writing style and proper citations for any external sources.
Presentation/Report Length: Your presentation should consist of a minimum of 10 slides. If you choose to write a report, it should be at least 2 pages in length (single-spaced).

Submission: Submit your presentation (as a PDF or PowerPoint file) or report (as a PDF document) on the course platform by the specified deadline.

Grading Criteria:
Your assignment will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

Depth and accuracy of the research on the selected scaling solution.
Clarity of explanations regarding how the solution works, its advantages, and potential drawbacks.
Proper citations and references for any external sources used.
Presentation quality (for presentations), including organization, visuals, and clarity.
Overall quality of writing (for reports) and organization.
